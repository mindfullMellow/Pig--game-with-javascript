# Description

The <strong> Pig Game</strong> is a simple 2-player dice game built with <em> HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </em>. It's a fun turn-based game where players roll a die and try to reach a score of <strong> <u> 100</u></strong> before the other player.

</strong>
</p>
<br>

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each player takes turns.
- On their turn, ,<strong> they can roll the die:</strong>
  - If the result is between the range of <strong>2–6</strong>, the number is <strong> added to their current score.</strong>
  - If the result is <strong> 1</strong>, they lose their current score, and it becomes the <strong> next player’s turn </strong>.
- At any point during their turn, a player can <strong> “Hold” </strong>:
  - This will <strong> save their current score </strong> to their total score, and then it becomes the other player's turn.
- First player to reach or pass <strong> 100 total points </strong>wins.
